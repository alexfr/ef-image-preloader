ef Image-Preloader

Requirements: None

This Library is a standalone component to preload images.
It cannot be used with the whole ef-library, if you want to do so, use that (maybe still not available as open source when you read this).
There are no library requirements, really, you don't need jQuery, but it works with jQuery too, if you want.  =)

The main purpose is to give the programmer a simple, but still flexible way to preload images.
You can organize images into groups and preload them at specific events if you want to do so,
but you can use the base functionality and preload them in just two lines of code.



Simple Example:

ef.utils.preload.add(['path/img1.jpg', 'path/img2.jpg]);
ef.utils.preload.run();


Example with Groups and custom preloading:

// Add the two image sets
ef.utils.preload.add(['path1/img1.jpg', 'path1/img2.jpg'], 'set1');
ef.utils.preload.add(['path2/img3.jpg', 'path2/img4.jpg'], 'set2');

// Preload the first image-set
ef.utils.preload.run('set1');

// How it would look like when preloading the second image-set on a click event using jQuery
$('#preload').on('click', function() {
    ef.utils.preload.run('set2');
});
